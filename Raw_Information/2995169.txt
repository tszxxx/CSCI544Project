Almost at same time, two works on the subject have spreaded among the HIV/Aids activists and NGOs in China, The Central Plains (2006), and Care and Love(2007), directed by Ai Xiaoming, a professor from Sun Yat-sen University, and filmed by herself and Hu Jie.\nCare and Love draws its inspiration from \u2018Investigation of HIV/AIDS in Xingtai\u2019, a feature article written by Wang Keqin, a senior journalist at China Economic Times, which tells the story of Liu Xianhong, a woman villager who contracted HIV through a blood transfusion during childbirth. The film documents how she publicized her story, filed a lawsuit with her 8-year-old son against the local hospital and eventually received compensation. The film also records the sufferings of several families and a collective effort to defend their own rights by people living with HIV/AIDS, who set up an organization, \u2018Care and Love Group\u2019. The film reveals an increasing awareness of civil rights in rural areas. Growing social concern, media intervention and legal aid have forced the local government to compromise and modify their policy, and improve the situation for AIDS patients. Care and Love thus shows the possibility for social change on the way to social

commentary:\nAi Xiaoming\nTo attain the quality of art is always my inspiration, and I very much hoped that film audience would regard my documentaries as art; unfortunately, some urban audiences consistently dismissed them as propagandistic and subjective. I was frustrated by these comments until I came across a statement by the Czech animator Jan Svankmajer who opened his new film Sileni with the following lines: \u2018This is not a work of art. Today, art is reduced to advertisements.\u2019\nIndeed, over time, not only can art degenerate into commodity, many people can also lose the ability to appreciate it. They are more receptive to entertainment than any messages the filmmaker and people from the villages might try to communicate. It becomes difficult to distinguish between what has been propagandized and what has been censored when people have long been unable to enjoy their right to access information\u2014they mistake propaganda for truth, and dismiss what is outside the scope of propaganda as lies. When I show audiences what they do not usually see, they say that my camera is so subjective\u2014yes, it quite often appears in my films and the villagers carried the tripod like my crew\u2014that it exaggerates reality, embellishing my ideals. They blame me for interviewing only villagers but not the government; only victims but not the police, and presenting only one-sided voice as a result. Consequently my films are criticized for not being \u2018as objective as CCTV\u2019, which, the urban audiences assume, neutrally shows what has happened by involving different voices.\nI do not want to comment on the techniques of my films, as people do not believe that they have any. I will focus on propaganda. In another astute comment, Svankmajer reflected: \u2018My film is indeed propaganda. So what? Do you think that I am not able to make propaganda?\u2019\nI want to add: why are we not allowed to propagandize the other side? In particular, why do people always call it propaganda whenever there is a message from the marginalized group? Is propaganda a privilege?\nI have been a scholar and professor for many years before joining the community of independent filmmakers. Just as I focused on certain subjects in my academic research, I also select particular issues when I film. I decide to work on a film after I have identified there is a problem, and my aim is to support and provoke change. When I made these films, I worked from the vantage point of the ordinary people, though it made me vulnerable to similar treatment. The authorities neither understood nor supported me, after I had taken the side of the villagers or forced to relocate households groups, and quite often they made it impossible for me to interview any officials. I was even detained at one point: a group of young police officers interrogated me, and I fully understood the meaning of humiliation. On the other hand, the people I interviewed became my real crew, they welcomed me quickly as one of them, and was willing to work with me for the program as their voice They always believed that my films would bring their sufferings of injustice to the authorities, make their appeal heard by the public, and eventually help resolve their problems. I have a clear project: I work with those issues and make documentaries in order to join their effort for the change\u2014a consequence is that I am not neutral at all. My role and my documentaries are inevitably regarded with suspicion.\nAs it is now, although the urban audiences are sceptical towards such documentaries and accuse them of being too propagandistic, the local authorities realize immediately that such kind of \u201cpropaganda\u201d should not be circulated. Coincidentally, the head of the local propaganda bureau, who knows perfectly well the power of propaganda, is the sister of the head of the local hospital documented in the film where the HIV-contaminated blood bank caused so many villagers to contract AIDS. Unsurprisingly, the local government has made their way to mobilizes the villagers to prevent the screening of the film. I very much hope to maintain a friendly relationship with the local government, but at the same time I cannot betray the villagers. I also think that in a society where care and love are so rare, why should Care and Love be forbidden? I sincerely hope that more people will see this film and ask themselves the question: under such fatal circumstances, what actions should one taken from the villagers, the government, and the judges?\nI repeat: do not regard the film as a work of art.
