  unfortunately   some   urban   audiences   consistently   dismissed   them   as   propagandistic   and   subjective   I   was   frustrated   by   these   comments   until   I   came   across   a   statement   by   the   Czech   animator   Jan   Svankmajer   who   opened   his   new   film   Sileni   with   the   following   lines   This   is   not   a   work   of   art   Today   art   is   reduced   to   advertisements   Indeed   over   time   not   only   can   art   degenerate   into   commodity   many   people   can   also   lose   the   ability   to   appreciate   it   They   are   more   receptive   to   entertainment   than   any   messages   the   filmmaker   and   people   from   the   villages   might   try   to   communicate   It   becomes   difficult   to   distinguish   between   what   has   been   propagandized   and   what   has   been   censored   when   people   have   long   been   unable   to   enjoy   their   right   to   access   information — they   mistake   propaganda   for   truth   and   dismiss   what   is   outside   the   scope   of   propaganda   as   lies   When   I   show   audiences   what   they   do   not   usually   see   they   say   that   my   camera   is   so   subjective — yes   it   quite   often   appears   in   my   films   and   the   villagers   carried   the   tripod   like   my   crew — that   it   exaggerates   reality   embellishing   my   ideals   They   blame   me   for   interviewing   only   villagers   but   not   the   government ;   only   victims   but   not   the   police   and   presenting   only   one sided   voice   as   a   result   Consequently   my   films   are   criticized   for   not   being   as   objective   as   CCTV   which   the   urban   audiences   assume   neutrally   shows   what   has   happened   by   involving   different   voices   I   do   not   want   to   comment   on   the   techniques   of   my   films   as   people   do   not   believe   that   they   have   any   I   will   focus   on   propaganda   In   another   astute   comment   Svankmajer   reflected   My   film   is   indeed   propaganda   So   what ?   Do   you   think   that   I   am   not   able   to   make   propaganda ?   I   want   to   add   why   are   we   not   allowed   to   propagandize   the   other   side ?   In   particular   why   do   people   always   call   it   propaganda   whenever   there   is   a   message   from   the   marginalized   group ?   Is   propaganda   a   privilege ?   I   have   been   a   scholar   and   professor   for   many   years   before   joining   the   community   of   independent   filmmakers   Just   as   I   focused   on   certain   subjects   in   my   academic   research   I   also   select   particular   issues   when   I   film   I   decide   to   work   on   a   film   after   I   have   identified   there   is   a   problem   and   my   aim   is   to   support   and   provoke   change   When   I   made   these   films   I   worked   from   the   vantage   point   of   the   ordinary   people   though   it   made   me   vulnerable   to   similar   treatment   The   authorities   neither   understood   nor   supported   me   after   I   had   taken   the   side   of   the   villagers   or   forced   to   relocate   households   groups   and   quite   often   they   made   it   impossible   for   me   to   interview   any   officials   I   was   even   detained   at   one   point   a   group   of   young   police   officers   interrogated   me   and   I   fully   understood   the   meaning   of   humiliation   On   the   other   hand   the   people   I   interviewed   became   my   real   crew   they   welcomed   me   quickly   as   one   of   them   and   was   willing   to   work   with   me   for   the   program   as   their   voice   They   always   believed   that   my   films   would   bring   their   sufferings   of   injustice   to   the   authorities   make   their   appeal   heard   by   the   public   and   eventually   help   resolve   their   problems   I   have   a   clear   project   I   work   with   those   issues   and   make   documentaries   in   order   to   join   their   effort   for   the   change — a   consequence   is   that   I   am   not   neutral   at   all   My   role   and   my   documentaries   are   inevitably   regarded   with   suspicion   As   it   is   now   although   the   urban   audiences   are   sceptical   towards   such   documentaries   and   accuse   them   of   being   too   propagandistic   the   local   authorities   realize   immediately   that   such   kind   of   propaganda   should   not   be   circulated   Coincidentally   the   head   of   the   local   propaganda   bureau   who   knows   perfectly   well   the   power   of   propaganda   is   the   sister   of   the   head   of   the   local   hospital   documented   in   the   film   where   the   HIV contaminated   blood   bank   caused   so   many   villagers   to   contract   AIDS   Unsurprisingly   the   local   government   has   made   their   way   to   mobilizes   the   villagers   to   prevent   the   screening   of   the   film   I   very   much   hope   to   maintain   a   friendly   relationship   with   the   local   government   but   at   the   same   time   I   cannot   betray   the   villagers   I   also   think   that   in   a   society   where   care   and   love   are   so   rare   why   should   Care   and   Love   be   forbidden ?   I   sincerely   hope   that   more   people   will   see   this   film   and   ask   themselves   the   question   under   such   fatal   circumstances   what   actions   should   one   taken   from   the   villagers   the   government   and   the   judges ?   I   repeat   do   not   regard   the   film   as   a   work   of   art   It   does   nothing   but   raises   questions   and   expects   solutions   cover   designed   by   兽兽 艾晓明
