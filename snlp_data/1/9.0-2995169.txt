the quality of art is always my inspiration and I very much hoped that film audience would regard my documentaries as art unfortunately some urban audiences consistently dismissed them as propagandistic and subjective I was frustrated by these comments until I came across a statement by the Czech animator Jan Svankmaj er who opened his new film Sileni with the following lines This is not a work of art Today art is reduced to advertisements Indeed over time not only can art degenerate into commodity many people can also lose the ability to appreciate it They are more receptive to entertainment than any messages the filmmaker and people from the villages might try to communicate It becomes difficult to distinguish between what has been propagandized and what has been censored when people have long been unable to enjoy their right to access mistake propaganda for truth and dismiss what is outside the scope of propaganda as lies When I show audiences what they do not usually see they say that my camera is so it quite often appears in my films and the villagers carried the tripod like my it exaggerates reality embellishing my ideals They blame me for interviewing only villagers but not the government only victims but not the police and presenting only voice as a result Consequently my films are criticized for not being objective as CCTV which the urban audiences assume neutrally shows what has happened by involving different voices I do not want to comment on the techniques of my films as people do not believe that they have any I will focus on propaganda In another astute comment Svankmajer reflected My film is indeed propaganda So what Doyou think that I am not able to make I want to add why are we not allowed to propagandize the other side In particular why do people always call it propaganda whenever there is a message from the marginalized group Is propaganda a privilege I have been a scholar and professor for many years before joining the community of independent filmmakers Just as I focused on certain subjects in my academic research I also select particular issues when I film I decide to work on a film after I have identified there is a problem and my aim is to support and provoke change When I made these films I worked from the vantage point of the ordinary people though it made me vulnerable to similar treatment The authorities neither understood nor supported me after I had taken the side of the villagers or forced to relocate households groups and quite often they made it impossible for me to intervi ew any officials I was even detained at one point a group of young police officers interrogated me and I fully understood the meaning of humiliation On the other hand the people I interviewed became my real crew they welcomed me quickly as one of them and was willing to work with me for the program as their voice They always believed that my films would bring their sufferings of injustice to the authorities make their appeal heard by the public and eventually help resolve their problems I have a clear project I work with those issues and make documentaries in order to join their effort for the consequence is that I am not neutral at all My role and my documentaries are inevitably regarded with suspicion As it is now although the urban audiences are sceptical towards such documentaries and accuse them of being too propagandistic the local authorities realize immediately that such kind of should not be circulated Coincidentally the head of the local propaganda bureau who knows perfectly well the power of propaganda is the sister of the head of the local hospital documented in the film where the blood bank caused so many villagers to contract AIDS Unsurprisingly the local government has made their way to mobiliz es the villagers to preve nt the screening of the film I very much hope to maintain a friendly relationship with the local government but at the same time I cannot betray the villagers I also think that in a society where care and love are so rare why should Care and Love be forbidden I sincerely hope that more people will see this film and ask themselves the question under such fatal circumstances what actions should one taken from the villagers the government and the judges I repeat do not regard the film as a work of art It does nothing but raises questions and expects solutions cover designed by 兽兽  艾晓明
